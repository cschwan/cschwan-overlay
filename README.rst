This is my personal overlay. It contains ebuilds and their dependencies for the
following programs:

  - app-cdr/mkcue: This is needed for CUE file creation compatible with
    media-sound/abcde
  - app-misc/mendeleydesktop: Scientific document file manager
  - dev-tex/biblatex-biber: Perl-based biblatex replacement for use with
    biblatex
  - kde-misc/ktikz: KDE drawing program for TikZ graphics
  - sci-physics/form: CAS intended for QFT calculations
